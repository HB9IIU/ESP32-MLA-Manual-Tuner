# Rotary Encoder Controller - Sender Code (ESP Attached to Encoder)

This folder contains the code for the **Sender ESP32**, which is attached to the rotary encoder.  

### Quick Start  
For detailed step-by-step instructions, please refer to the main project documentation in the **`Documentation`** folder or the project root README.  

### Included Files  
- **`IOTest.cpp__`**: Test script for verifying connections to the rotary encoder and LEDs.  
- **`Sender.cpp`**: Main sender code for reading encoder input and transmitting step deltas to the receiver.  

Please ensure only one `.cpp` file is active at a time by renaming others with a `__` at the end to avoid compilation errors.
